This is a starship.toml configuration file based on 'Pastel Powerline' preset' i have tried to customise it using Nordic color palette.
Although i would like to point out the fact that it is not purely based on Nordic theme as i have used two colors from 'Dracula' theme, because i was running short of two colors and the Dracula colors mixed will with Nordic palette.
You will also need to download the 'Nerd fort', i am using DroidSansMono Nerd Font Mono' in my terminal and have included a shell script to download and unzip the same font, but if you wish to use any other font you may use it.
